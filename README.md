### How to play with Oculus Quest 2


#### Right controller

* **Seconday button(B)** Skip the intro (Starwars-style rolling paragraph)

* **Primary button(A)** Detect objects that could be distance-grabbed

* **Grip** Grab objects (by contact or by distance grab)

* **Trigger** Interact with interactable objects



#### Left controller

* **Seconday button(Y)** No use temporarily

* **Primary button(X)** Bring the clipboard nearby

* **Grip & Trigger** Same as the ones on right controller


#### How to win

Put items on the clipboard. If it is the correct answer, the board will collect it. Otherwise, it won't. 
And there are different prompts and SFX during different situations.


#### Other features

* Kinematic(not affected by physical power) GameObjects would slowly get back to their original position when players let it go. Non-kinematic GameObjects would get back immediately after the release.

* Drop the clipboard on the floor to restart the game.
