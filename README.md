# RP_Project4
A 3D "I Spy Books"-like Unity Game, aiming for fun and cognition exercise, in Cubism artstyle.

### How to play with Oculus Quest 2


#### Right controller

* **Seconday button(B)** Skip the intro (Starwars-style rolling paragraph)

* **Primary button(A)** Detect objects that could be distance-grabbed (available ones 
would show a cross hair)

* **Grip** grab objects (by contact or by distance grab)

* **Triger** interact with interactable objects



#### Left controller

* **Seconday button(Y)** No use temporarily

* **Primary button(X)** bring the clipboard nearby

* **Grip & Triger** same as the ones on right controller


#### How to win

Put items on the clipboard; if it is the correct answer, the board will collect it. Otherwise, it 
won't. And there are different prompts and SFX during different situations.


#### Other features

* The Fusebox is an example of the 3D sound. Players would hear a louder humming when 
approaching.

* The gray sphere is kinematic(not affected by physical power); it would slowly get back to 
its original position when players let it go. The bubble gun is not kinematic; it would get 
back immediately after the release.

* Drop the clipboard on the floor to restart the game.
